                <p>This Policy applies to the entire process of your use of the Smart Camera Glasses (hereinafter referred to as "Smart Glasses") and the supporting APP (hereinafter referred to as "this APP"). It primarily covers the "AI Interaction Information Upload" scenario. Photos, audio, and video files you capture or record using the Smart Glasses are stored locally on the glasses or paired phone by default; we do not actively collect or upload them. Personal information is only transmitted to third-party AI servers when necessary to provide the specific intelligent services you activate, such as AI Q&A, image recognition, and multilingual translation.</p>

                <p>We only transmit corresponding information to third-party AI servers when you actively trigger the following intelligent functions. This information is used solely for generating the service results and does not include unrelated personal information such as your name, phone number, or device contacts.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>AI Q&A Function:</strong> Only the text content or voice snippet you input is uploaded. Voice is converted to text in real-time before transmission; the original audio is processed temporarily only on the local device. This is used by the third-party server to understand the request and return an answer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Image Recognition Function:</strong> Only the image you actively select for recognition is uploaded. Before upload, the APP automatically de-identifies the image, removing sensitive information such as faces, ID numbers, street addresses, and license plate numbers that might be present, retaining only image feature data relevant to the recognition target.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multilingual Translation Function (including dialogue translation and simultaneous interpretation):</strong> Only the text fragment or real-time transcribed speech you need translated is uploaded. This content is promptly deleted from the third-party server after translation is completed.</li>

                <div class="highlight">
                    <strong>Special Note:</strong> Photos, audio recordings, and videos stored locally on your Smart Glasses or paired phone will not be automatically uploaded to any server unless you actively click the share button. You have full control over these files through the device's local storage management functions.

                    <li><strong>Right to Deletion:</strong> You can independently delete all personally identifiable information stored locally via the device's file management or the supporting App's local data cleanup functions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> If you find errors or incompleteness in your personal information (e.g., device adaptation info, authorization settings), you can make corrections through the "Me - Personal Information Management" page in the supporting App.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Local Data Security:</strong> Local storage on the Smart Glasses and bound mobile phone utilizes partitioned encryption mechanisms. Only the authorized product application can access relevant data; reading by other third-party applications is prohibited. Support for device lock screen passwords and biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint, facial recognition) prevents data leakage in case of device loss or theft.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Transmission Security:</strong> During data transmission for "AI Q&A, Image Recognition, Dialogue Translation, Simultaneous Interpretation" functions, the TLS 1.3 encryption protocol is used for end-to-end encryption to prevent data theft or tampering during transmission. A data verification mechanism ensures data integrity and accuracy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Third-Party Server Data Security Control:</strong> We sign strict data security agreements with AI service providers, explicitly requiring them to use AES-256 encryption for stored transmitted data, establish graded access control mechanisms, and ensure compliance with requirements of laws and regulations such as the Personal Information Protection Law and the Data Security Law of the People's Republic of China.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security Incident Response:</strong> We have established a comprehensive data security incident response plan. In the event of a security incident such as a data breach, tampering, or loss, the emergency plan will be activated immediately, implementing remedial measures like data isolation, vulnerability patching, and information tracing. As required by laws and regulations, we will notify you promptly within 72 hours via App push notifications, SMS, or phone calls.</li>
